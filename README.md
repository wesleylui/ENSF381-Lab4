# ENSF381-Lab4

# Project Overview
- This lab consisted of creating a repository and commiting the initial contents in the zip package provided on D2L. We were tasked with writing CSS code to make the webpage layout responsive to the size of our browser. We had different properties for the width in pixels of our webpages based on if the user was using a desktop, a tablet, or a mobile device. 
- In ExerciseB we worked with block dispays, padding, margins, clear, float, and box-sizing. We also had to adjust the .gap class to make the content readable at the bottom of the page, we had to make sure the footer didn't block our news items.
- In ExerciseC we used the Flex technique to do the same styling as ExerciseB. We used flex displays, flex-wrap, and flex-direction in both the column and row direction.
